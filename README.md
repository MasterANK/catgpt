# catgpt

## CatGPT is parody to ChatGPT, It is heavily inspired by the Duck Debugger used in Harvard CS50 Course.

#
CatGPT is the most advance AI that will ever exist in our universe. In fact its so advance that we cannot really understand the output it gives out.
It is using a far superior language of cat. With the power of GPT-♾️ it can give most compact response with no time delay.


To be fair its all for the memes as how ChatGPT is very similar to CatGPT. 

It also got some easter egg so don't be suprise.

***Remember: Do not "meow" back to the AI***
